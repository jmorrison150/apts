    <h2>The Art of Apartment Hunting</h2>
    <h3>John Morrison</h3>

        John Snow didn't use his map to discover, he used it to persuade. 
    </h2>
   <p>
        In class we studied John Snow's famous 1854 map of cholera outbreaks in London. At the time, there were competing theories about the source of cholera. Some said it was air-borne, human-to-human contact, or elevation. Snow had been studying cholera for several years and made the connection to the intestinal tract, which suggested water-borne transmission.
        <br />
        Some companies in London were pumping contaminated water from the Thames. Snow was able to get the pump closed, and the epidemic subsided.
        <br />
        The case of the Broad Street water pump is a great example of a map that has a call to action. By plotting each death with the the same size box, people were able to draw their own conclusions.

    <h2>
        Social Cartography
    </h2>
    <p>
        In the 1889 Charles Booth published his Poverty Map of London. He colored the income of each neighborhood street by street. Cartographers followed police men in their rounds and interviewed people. From pages and pages of notes, classifications were assigned in discrete steps. Similar colors with were assigned to similar incomes.

    <h2>One Dot Equals One Person</h2>
    <p>
        Eric Fischer has colored his maps. He used the 2010 US census for his source. In the census, people self-identify their race. Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, Other. Fischer uses this as ordinal data, and assigns a color to each category. The outline of the census tract is used to distribute one dot for each person randomly within the boundary. This produces a slightly diffuse appearance, but it seems more realistic of the complexities of city life than harshly delineated choropleth maps.
        <br />
        The segregation is shocking.

        Jeff Kaufman has been a great resource. It because of Jeff that I am able to get my data. He published a technique for scraping Padmapper. I've been running this script once a month to get a picture of different cities across the United States.

    <p>
        Padmapper aggregates sites like craigslist.com and rent.com. The main innovation from padmapper is the display of this information geospatially. It provides a real-time snapshot of the market.
